# Projects-Work-Assignments
 Here is a place to view some of my best work from both my Bachalor's degree and Masters degree.
 For the File containing my BSc project code (analysis of galaxy clusters), there is a sample of the cluster data that can be used to test the functions.
 
 The Jupiter notebooks should be visible on github (or they can be opened in google colab).
