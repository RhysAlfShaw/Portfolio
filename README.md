# Portfolio of my notable work.
 Here is a place to view some of my best work from both my Bachalor's degree and Masters degree.
 For the File containing my BSc project code (analysis of galaxy clusters), there is a sample of the cluster data that can be used to test the functions.
 
 The Jupiter notebooks should be visible on github (or they can be opened in google colab).

 ## This Portfolio Contain the following:
 
 -  The techniques used in my BSc project analyising Galaxy Clusters.
 -  The End-to-End analysis of a gravitational wave event.
 -  A Library to create stellar clusters with desired condtions and planetary systems, developed for my on going MSc porject on the stability of planetary systesm in stellar clusters.
 -  A MCMC algorithm for finding best fit parameters for a preprocessed gravitational wave event.
 -  A Machine learning case study, testing multiple models on a online retailers datasets to predict user purchase intensions.
 -  A Simulation of a particle detector using Monte-carlo methods.
